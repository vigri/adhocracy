****** INTRODUCTION ******

After executing "sh build.sh" Google Chrome and Chromedriver will be installed automatically and you are ready to execute the tests.
If you want support for HTMLUnit, Firefox, distributed testing and so on, please execute setup.sh inside the selenium directory.


**** Distributed testing ****

** Linux **
Execute python selenium_node.py [BROWSERNAME] to offer your machine as a node with the specified browser.
On linux machines you need to execute setup.sh to offer other browsers than Google Chrome.


** Windows **
Unfortunately there is no setup-script for windows machines yet.
Please execute the following steps to offer your machine as a node for distributed testing:

Google Chrome
1) Download and install Google Chrome from http://www.google.de/intl/de/chrome/browser/

3) Copy Google Chromedriver to res/windows/chrome

Mozilla Firefox
1) Download and install Mozilla Firefox from http://www.mozilla.org/

HTMLUnit

2) Copy the .jar file to res/all/selenium

Internet Explorer
